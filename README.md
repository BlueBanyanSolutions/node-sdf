A node wrapper for Netsuite Suitescript Development Framework CLI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install # downloads and installs the sdfcli dependencies
```

> Add your netsuite credentials to config files if the generated `.sdf` files should be prefilled with your credentials

## Usage

### General use
The idea is to use the NetSuite sdfcli in a node environment and supplying a way of generating boilerplate code for SDF projects 

### Use `sdf` command globally
```bash
npm install -g && npm link # once
sdf [options]
```

### Use locally
```bash
./cli/sdf.js [options]
```

### Access Help Menus

```bash
# global
sdf -h

# local
./cli/sdf.js -h
```
___

Following args can be used when calling cli command

```javascript
{
    -p: 'path' // path to create project in,
    -P: 'password' // password of netsuite account,
}
```

## Implemented commands

### sdf create

Command line interface to create sdf project boilerplate

```bash
sdf create
```

### sdf <cmd>

Route commands to sdfcli

```bash
# eg listfiles
sdf listfiles folder=/SuiteScripts,url=system.eu1.netsuite.com,email=foo@bar.com,account=12345678,role=3
# arguments for sdfcli have to be specified as key value pairs (foo=bar will be translated to -foo bar for sdfcli)
```

As the commands are routed through to the original NetSuite sdfcli - the following commands are implemented.
