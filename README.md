This is a node wrapper for Netsuite Suitescript Development Framework CLI. It provides the necessary dependencies to run the `sdfcli` in an encapsulated manner (NO global JAVA installation required!).
Additionally a wrapper that can be used to create project structures and call sdf commands in a node script is provided through methods in `index.js`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install # downloads and installs the sdfcli dependencies
```

## Usage

### Methods node wrapper
Following methods can be called and used for use of the `sdfcli` in a node script.

#### sdf
> Please refer to the official NetSuite documentation for information about the commands and their required params
The `sdf` method can be used to directly call `sdfcli` commands:

```javascript
sdf('cmd', 'password', { path: 'path' }) // timeout in ms can be specified as last param (stalls hanging processes after 10s by default)
    .then(res => console.log(res))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

#### sdfCreateAccountCustomizationProject
The `sdfCreateAccountCustomizationProject` creates the `sdf` boilerplate for an ACCOUNTCUSTOMIZATION in the specified directory:

```javascript
const res = sdfCreateAccountCustomizationProject('NAME', 'PATH');
/**
  *  {
  *      type: 'ACCOUNTCUSTOMIZATION',
  *      dir: '/absolutepath/PATH/NAME',
  *      name: 'NAME',
  *      values: { name: 'NAME' }
  *  }
  */
```

#### sdfCreateSuiteAppProject
The `sdfCreateSuiteAppProject` creates the `sdf` boilerplate for a SUITEAPP in the specified directory:

```javascript
const res = sdfCreateSuiteAppProject('NAME', 'ID', 'VERSION', 'PUBLISHERID', 'PATH');
/**
  *  {
  *      type: 'SUITEAPP',
  *      dir: '/absolutepath/PATH/PUBLISHERID.ID',
  *      name: 'PUBLISHERID.ID',
  *      values: {
  *         publisherId: 'PUBLISHERID',
  *         id: 'ID',
  *         name: 'NAME',
  *         version: 'VERSION'
  *     }
  *  }
  */
```


### General use CLI
The idea is to use the NetSuite sdfcli in a node environment and provide a way to generate boilerplate code for SDF projects 

#### Install and use commands globally
```bash
npm install -g
sdfcli [options]
sdfcli-createproject [options]
```

#### Use commands locally
```bash
./sdfcli [options]
./sdfcli-createproject [options]
```

#### Commands
As the commands are routed through to the original NetSuite sdfcli - the following commands are implemented.
